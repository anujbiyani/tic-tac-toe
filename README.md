# Tic Tac Toe

An exercise in scaling code.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy the files in template to your machine
2. Open the code by changing the path in the following to match where you downloaded your file, and then paste the URL into your browser:
    ```
    file:///Users/abiyani/code/tech_offsite_2022/index.html
    ```
3. Open `index.html` and `index.js` in your text editor
    - We won't worry about the CSS. That's a whole 'nother beast
4. Start by implementing `selectBox`

## Development Instructions

1. In the `selectBox` function, mark the correct box in `boxes` as selected by the `currentPlayer`
2. Update the UI with the player's selection
3. Set the `currentPlayer` to the next player

Tic Tac Toe is now functional! But...there's a lot left to build.

1. Tell the player when they've won
    - make the grid not-editable
2. Don't allow a player to select a square that's already been selected
3. Enable scaling the grid from 3x3 to NxN
